<span class="markdown">This ontology provides a semantic framework for representing
key components of the Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS),
including subjects, clinical measurements, code metadata,
dataset-level provenance, subject splits, and prediction labels.

The ontology is accompanied by SHACL shapes that constrain
and validate data according to the MEDS conceptual model,
enabling consistent data representation and quality control
across implementations.</span>
